# Next.js 15 Data Fetching Bug

This repository demonstrates a data fetching issue in a Next.js 15 application.  The issue occurs when navigating directly to a page that fetches data from an API route without first visiting another page.

## Bug Description

The application has a homepage (`/`) and an about page (`/about`). The about page fetches data from an API route (`/api/data`). When navigating to `/about` directly, the data fails to load, and the page displays "Loading..." indefinitely.  However, if the homepage is visited first, then navigating to `/about` works correctly. 

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate directly to `/about`.  The page will show "Loading..."
5. Navigate to `/`. 
6. Navigate to `/about`. The data will load successfully. 

## Solution

The solution involves using the `revalidate` option in the API route or implementing a fallback mechanism in the about page to handle the initial data loading state more gracefully.
